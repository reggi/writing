# How Holstee manages it's content with Shopify

_Friday, February 27, 2015 at 5:12:47 PM_

Where do I begin? I want say something like "At Holstee we like to deliver the best shopping experience", as a matter of fact I just did. While that sounds super cheesy (and I know it does), it's true. One of the ways we do this is by "delivering" great content. The goal is to have deep, detailed, heartfelt and most importantly beautifully displayed content.

## A little background context

Hi! My name is Thomas Reggi. I identify most importantly as a human being, secondly I'm a full stack developer. What does that mean? It means I've curated many different technologies over the years. I importantly consider myself an avid and active part of the JavaScript community (I'm currently organizing a coding conference [EmpireJS](http://2015.empirejs.org/), check it out!).

Who cares? Even though I've build NodeJS apps that have been put into production, my day-to-day is maintaining an e-commerce shopify theme, and that kills me inside. Shopify themes are very similar to Wordpress themes. Shopify uses the [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) templating language. All templating languages are really limited, especially when your trying to build a very complicated site with blogs, products, events, download, team pages etc. I have started to compile [list of shopify liquid features, bugs, and hacks](https://github.com/reggi/shopify/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aliquid).

I feel like I have my hands tied around my back when I work with the Shopify platform. The latest trend in websites is [Single-page application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_applications) and [Isomorphic JavaScript](http://isomorphic.net/) (JavaScript applications that can run both client-side and server-side.The backend and frontend share the same code.) Shopify is not conducive to this using these cutting edge frameworks. I've tried very hard to use Shopify with frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). 

SEO is super important when it comes to e-commerce so the lack of access Shopify gives you on the server side of things means even if you could get one of these frameworks working, it wouldn't be worth it. Even cutting edge web technologies like Polymer are a pain in the butt to work with, and you need to know Shopify's quirks in order to [hack something together](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize/issues/138#issuecomment-76032971).

> Shopify does its best to deliver a great platform for e-commerce. As a full-stack developer I feel constricted by the control I have.

## What I've Learned over the years

I've build over 3 Shopify themes from scratch over the years, and the current Holstee theme (figaro) has almost 300 commits and over 30 open issues. Here's what I've learned.

* Just because you can solve something by hardcoding it doesn't mean you should, _especially when it comes to content_ I hate typo fix commits
* Abstraction is an endless pursuit, there's always more to abstract
* Simpler design = less custom content, less code, and less metafields
* Less code more conditionals
* Modularization & compartmentalization (Thanks UNIX! [here](http://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0?t=3m14s) and [here](http://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0?t=25m29s))

## The specific problems with content

The meat and the potatoes...
