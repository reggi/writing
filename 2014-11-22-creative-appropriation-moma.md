# Creative Appropriation: A Day at MoMA

Today I attended a class at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), led by [Michael Mandiberg](http://www.mandiberg.com/). The course was titled [Creative Appropriation](http://moma.org/learn/courses/courses#course236), some of the details are [on the MoMA Learning site](http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/blog/creative-appropriation-the-smallest-move-is-often-the-hardest). When I signed up for the class I had no clue what "Creative Appropriation" or "Art Appropriation" meant. I had a hunch it had to do with the ideas of copying, borrowing, remixing, and sampling, but, it turns out, I had no clue what was in store for me.

The class was held in the beautiful education building right down the block from the actual museum. When you walk in you immediately see an amazing [red formula-one Ferrari on the wall](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2797/4114744346_f58dc5118c_z.jpg?zz=1) and several of Andy Warhol's screen-printed cows. Not long after I arrived our group gathered in the classroom. We went around the room and introduced ourselves and explained our interests in taking the class. Some of my fellow classmates were artists, others had never taken any kind of art class. From there we quickly headed to the museum.

We started as a group in a big gallery space standing across from Vincent van Gogh's iconic work, ["The Starry Night"](http://www.moma.org/collection_images/resized/075/w500h420/CRI_133075.jpg). I have been in this room many times, and every time I feel a sense of wonder. It's like waiting in line at a cafe when you notice that there is a celebrity two people behind you, you try to sneak a peek at them without being noticed. I'd argue it's even better than that, because you are allowed to be a voyeur, you are encouraged to stare deeply. The room is filled with ["post-impressionist"](http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173) work: a Seurat here, a Van Gogh there, a Rousseau sneaks up behind you, then out of the corner of your eye a Picasso. A genre, like post-impressionism, dates the work, giving us insight into the world at that time, and creating a richer and fuller story. We learned that the significance of post-impressionism is that it was the start of a fundamental shift in the way art was made. Before photography art was made mainly for the purpose of representing reality. Photography allowed for a "perfect" representation of the world. It is a scary thought that art was once constrained by "reality". Contemporary art is a vehicle to express concepts, not to perfectly represent realism. It is inspiring that one innovation or small invention can have such an effect on society and artistic expression. I never thought that something so seemingly innocuous, like the camera, could change the purpose of art and the role of the artist forever.

The idea that art is produced linearly fascinates me. With this taken into consideration, one must note that a work of art references what came before it. What is more interesting is the idea that artistic works also reference the state of the world in which they were made, they are snapshots of humanity, slices in time. There is a string that ties every piece together, that connects every work of art. Each piece adds to the story, and becomes an artifact left with intention. This story can be traced back to the first cave paintings and handprints. I have always viewed works of art as self-contained objects, but without context much of their meaning is lost. Now I appreciate the bigger picture: the global narrative of art.

Going through MoMA's galleries with Mandiberg, someone who is explaining the context around the different works, was immensely beneficial to my overall understanding of the work. Instead of remotely hearing or reading about the strings that tie art together I was there with the original works. This opportunity allowed me to explore the physical space where they reside, letting me be a part of their histories. I became more excited toward the end of the class. I really wanted to acknowledge the fast transition from the past to the present. I became fascinated with the history of the works, the inter-weaving histories leading to today and understanding how we got to the present. 

Everything led up to MoMA's _Sturtevant_ exhibit, which contained recent work that referenced classical art. We stood in front of a series of televisions. They formed an upside-down triangle. Each television was playing the same video and most of the clips were loops. The televisions were not the usual art-gallery kind (CRT cubes) they were flat LCD screens. Something about the piece felt very modern. Especially when you think about where we had started earlier in the day, looking at works that are over a hundred years old. 

We then went back to the classroom where we explored some online projects. Here I was reminded that the computer had the same effect on art that the camera once did, and that history is known to repeat itself from time to time. Everyone in the class was shown how to make GIFs by using online tools that convert Youtube videos.

This class was extremely worthwhile, I got a lot out of the experience. To be honest, initially I felt intimidated by the art world, it can be a very unnerving place. I believe I got something out of the class, something that connects me to a bigger picture of meaning and to humanity. 

Alright, enough of this mushy stuff, lets get to the [GIFs we made](http://agiftohumanity.tumblr.com/).
