# Learning and Teaching

The fundamental process of learning takes place in the self. When this idea came into my head, I quickly jotted it down as “self-learning”. This notion came to me during a talk given by [Tracy Hinds](https://twitter.com/hackygolucky) at [Brooklyn.js](http://brooklynjs.com/) in October of 2014.

Tracy was describing a story in which a child asks someone: What’s the biggest number? I thought immediately of my own reaction. I’d describe that there’s no such thing as the biggest number: numbers can go on infinitely. This knee-jerk thought process occurred to me in a matter of seconds, It seams simple enough right?

Tracy said, when it comes to questions like these you’re always supposed to answer a question with another question. In her story, she says that every number the child came up with was combatted by adding 1 to it. The idea is that the child would realize on their own they can't conceive of a number larger then the last, the abstract idea of the infinite.

As simple as it may seem, Tracy's story has changed the way I think about learning, as well as educating. I like to think of communication as the teleportation of one idea, notion or concept from one brain to another. This makes communication a messy ordeal, littered with misunderstandings, and error. If you’ve ever played the telephone game you know what I’m talking about. 

My realization is that it’s not about how well, how articulate, or how direct you approach a subject matter, it’s about how considerate you are when you approach it. It’s about being empathetic to the other person. An idea may be shocking, impossible, mind-blowing, and challenge the listener. You, as an educator, can structure a conversation in such a graceful way that it can lead to them figuring out the notion out for themselves. As a teacher you have to be compassionate, understand the subject matter, and a correct way to approach it. Ultimately it means as an educator you have to be wise and patient.

I say teacher as if it needs to be a profession, but I really mean anyone who wishes to dispense any sort of knowledge. In this day and age all of us are students as well as teachers. We always have something to learn, and something to provide the community. You can only truly learn something new if you open yourself up to change, and allow yourself to consider the unconsidered.

Since that day I've come across this great Zen story (in [GEB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)) that I think plays a big part in this idea of discovery.

> Two men were arguing about a flag flapping in the wind. "It's the wind that is really moving," stated the first one. "No, it is the flag that is moving," contended the second. A Zen master, who happened to be walking by, overheard the debate and interrupted them. "Neither the flag nor the wind is moving," he said, "It is MIND that moves."
