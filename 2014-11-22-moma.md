# Creative Appropriation: a Day at MoMA

Today I attended a class at The Museum of Modern Art, led by [Michael Mandiberg](http://www.mandiberg.com/). The course was titled [Creative Appropriation](http://moma.org/learn/courses/courses#course236), some of the details are [on the MoMA Learning site](http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/blog/creative-appropriation-the-smallest-move-is-often-the-hardest). When I signed up for the class I really had no clue what "Creative Appropriation" or "Art Appropriation" really meant. I had a hunch it had to do with the notions of copying, borrowing, remixing, and sampling, things like that.

First off the class was held in the beautiful education building right down the block from the actual museum. Right when you walk in you see this amazing [red formula-one Ferrari on the wall](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2797/4114744346_f58dc5118c_z.jpg?zz=1), and a whole much of Warhol's screenprinted cows. Not long after I arrived, we all gather into the class room. We all go around the room and all give introductions, a nice way to meet everyone and see what everyones interests are. From there, we quickly head over to the other building to check out some art.

We started in a big gallery space in a group standing across from one of Vincent van Gogh's iconic works ["The Starry Night"](http://www.moma.org/collection_images/resized/075/w500h420/CRI_133075.jpg). I've been in this room before, and every time I feel this sense of wonder. It's like waiting in line at a cafe when you notice theres a celebrity two people behind you, that your trying to get a peek at, but your being a creeper. I'd argue it's even better than that, you're allowed to be a weirdo, your encouraged to stare deeply! Seurat here, van Gogh their, a Rousseau creeps up behind you, then out of the corner of your eye a Picasso, it's all very intense! The name for all these types of works is ["post-imperssionist"](http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173).

What dawned on me early in the day was an intense sense of scale that plays when it comes to art. A genre like post-impressionist puts a tag on a work. Most importantly it dates the work, which is important because it gives some insight on the status of the world at that time, creating a richer and fuller story about the work.

The significance of post-impressionism, was that it was the start of a fundamental shift in the way art was made. I never thought about the idea that before photography, art was about representing reality. Photography allowed for a "perfect" representation of realty. It's a scary and inspiring thought that one innovation or a small invention can have an effect on society, and artistic form. I never had the thought that something so seemingly innocent could change the function of art.

This notion that works of art are produced in a linear way, and reference past works and also reference the state of the world in which they were made is a really profound. It's like there's a string that ties every piece together. Each piece creates a story, and is an artifact left with intention. A story that can be traced back to the first cave paintings and handprints.

I've always seen a work of art as this self-contained object, but without context much of meaning is lost, and you're just left with a bunch of subjectively beautiful objects.

Going through the different galleries of the MoMA with a Mandiberg, someone who's explaining the context around the different works was immensely beneficial to my overall understanding of the works. This is very important, instead of hearing or reading about these strings that tie art together I was there, with the original works. This opportunity allowed me to sink into the physical space where they now reside, and in a way allowed me to be apart of this history of the work.

What I was most excited for was this history that led up to the present moment. Really understanding how we got here. Everything led up to MoMA's _Sturtevant_ exhibit, which was really interesting, all pretty recent work that references all the classics. We got to a point where we were standing in front of a series of televisions. They all formed this weird upside-down triangle. Each television was playing the same video and most of the clips were loops. The televisions were't the normal art-gallery kind, they were flat LCD screens. Something about the whole piece felt very new. Especially when you think about where we started earlier in the class, looking at collage and other works over a hundred years old. We went back to the classroom where we then explored some online works. Within this realm I was reminded that the computer had the same effect on art that the camera did. Everyone in the class was shown how to make GIFs buy using online tools that convert youtube videos.

There's so much that I got out of this experience and I'm really glad I wen't. To be honest I felt intimidated at first glance of all this stuff, the art world is a very scary place to some. I believe I got something out of it, something that connects me to a bigger picture of meaning and to truly with humanity. Alright, enough of this mushy stuff, lets get to the [GIFs we made](http://agiftohumanity.tumblr.com/).
