# Software For Art Day 2014

This past Saturday [November 16th, 2014] I attended [Software For Artists Day (#S4AD)](softwareforartistsday.com), a one day event pertaining to all things at the intersection of software and art. The venue was one of my favorite places in all the world, the notorious [Pioneer Works](http://pioneerworks.org/). 

The first time you walk into Pioneer Works, regardless of what exhibitions are being shown, you get a feel for the volume and scale of the space, and it's beautiful minimalist simplicity. The only way I can describe it is, when your in the space have you the freedom to think, a place to be intentional, and thats where the magic happens. Pioneer Works prides itself on being a center for art an innovation, all the while perched [right on the outskirts of Brooklyn in Red Hook](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pioneer+Works/@40.679158,-74.012228,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25a8a1abfdfb9:0xc48631e0fdda4d1c).

What I love is hearing other people's passion projects. Hearing what others are working on really inspires me. I'm trying to understand their process, searching for any explanation why their doing what their doing. I love hearing how they got to where they are, their past experience and learnings. My work is so digital and shapeless, I really appreciate people working with physical things. This was the mindset I had when I signed up for Software For Art Day, to learn more about the intersection of software and art.

One of my favorite talks was about, of all things sheet-metal. The talk was by [Jamie Zigelbaum](https://twitter.com/jamiezigelbaum). He spoke of his work ["Triangular Series"](http://www.jamiezigelbaum.com/#/triangular-series/), a mass of stalagmite-like shapes filled with sensors, raspberry pi's and LED's. His talk was about the benefits of using sheet-metal over 3D printing. I never thought about sheet-metal as a medium before and it seems really robust, simple to design, and cheap. For this project specifically Zigelbaum wanted something strong, something that he would feel comfortable dangling over the heads of the people underneath. Then I had a brief primer on SolidWorks the 3D modeling software. He made it look super easy to create a piece of metal. I love the idea that this digital thing could easily be ordered and arrive in the physical world at my doorstep couple of days later.

[Ariel Cotton](https://twitter.com/ericcorriel) was talking about Design and Interface. She laid out one of the best explanations of the loaded words "design" and "interface" I've ever heard. Then she brought both of these abstract concepts together in an amazing way that made complete sense.

I was so conceptually captivated by a talk by [Eric Corriel](https://twitter.com/ericcorriel). He was driven by this urge to create a cube of light. His process was amazing. He has this time-lapse video of him experimenting with a whole bunch of different light sources, lasers and projectors. He made custom projector encasements that allowed for only a thin plane of light to escape. More about his project ["lightbox"](http://www.ericcorriel.com/art/lightbox/) over on his [website](http://www.ericcorriel.com), check it out it's really cool.

I learned a whole bunch of new and cool things, I met some cool people, and I had some interesting discussions. Overall it was a really great experience. There were so many people using code to make some widget, or some product, some artifact, something tangible. It’s really amazing what people are doing. These projects create experiences for people, they’re emotional, memorable, tangible, they have a point, they invoke intention and purpose. I really want to remember the sense of wonder and inspiration after leaving this event. I feel inspired to inspire others, a little livley and fired up, and very curious.

There's a ton of work that goes into planning an event like this. The whole thing was organized by the amazing, David Sheinkopf, the Director of Education at Pioneer Works. He also did a presentation titled "Sensors + Automation with Arduino", which I happened to catch a small bit of. I just wanted to mention thanks to David along with all the presenters, volunteers, and organizers as well as Pioneer Works!
